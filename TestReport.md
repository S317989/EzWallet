# Integration approach

In our project implementation, we have chosen to adopt a "Bottom-Up Integration" approach as our preferred integration strategy. This approach allows us to initially test the lower-level components, which serve as the foundational building blocks of the system, and gradually progress towards integrating the higher-level units.

Here is the sequence of steps we followed:

| Steps  | Object's argument                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 1 | We initiated the integration process by testing the functionality of the "Authentication" unit to ensure that the entire authentication system operates correctly.                                                                      |
| Step 2 | Subsequently, we proceeded to the "Utils" component, as it serves primarily as a support module for the entire system and its units.                                                                                                    |
| Step 3 | After confirming the functionality of the fundamental units, we conducted tests on the "Users" component to ensure proper management of system users, privileges, and gain a clear understanding of the system actors.                  |
| Step 4 | Finally, we concluded with the integration of the "Controller" unit, which represents the highest and most complex level. We deliberately addressed it last to resolve any issues that may have arisen from the other supporting units. |

Upon completing the aforementioned steps, we conducted Integration Tests of the APIs by utilizing the routes defined in "Route.js". These tests aimed to verify the seamless flow of requests and responses across the various integrated units and components, ensuring the end-to-end functionality of the system.
